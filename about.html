        <h1>Benitez Los Angeles Design & Construction</h1>
        <p>
          We can figure that out by knowing how many windows will it have, how
          many doors, the quality of the finish work (countertop, flooring,
          etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADU’s are fast becoming a very popular
          part of Los Angeles homes. With the rising costs of rent and the small
          availability of affordable housing many have begun to convert garages,
          attics, basements or even add small units on their property to rent
          out. The addition of rental income means that you can do more of the
          things you like to do without having to work harder and you have
          instantly added value to your property. Congrats! You have decided to
          convert your empty garage into an ADU, you know what you would like to
          do but are concerned about the costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation of beginning the project you can give us a call for a
          free consultation. Building an ADU may seem like it could be a DIY,
          but it will require a foundation, framing, wiring and plumbing and not
          to mention if you plan on renting it out or possibly selling your
          property one day the ADU will need to be up to code. The best way to
          ensure that the cost is kept under budget is to design the ADU first.
        </p>
        <h1 class="cost">The Cost To Build A Benitez</h1>
        <p>
          <b>
            During the floor plan design process, we can figure out the exact
            cost for your ADU or garage conversion.
          </b>
          We can figure that out by knowing how many windows will it have, how
          many doors, the quality of the finish work (countertop, flooring,
          etc).
        </p>
        <b>
          You can call around getting estimates from many contractors but no one
          will give you a 100% accurate number because you don’t have the Floor
          Plan Blueprints.
        </b>
        <p>
          If you call around to contractors, you can give a general idea of what
          you plan on doing for the conversion and they can supply you with a
          free estimate. Keep in mind that the price you get will be an estimate
          so you should plan on a little less or more depending on the job. An
          estimate will give you a good starting point in your project though.
          From there you can decide on extras you would want to add or maybe
          items to scale back. The biggest thing to keep in mind when starting
          this project is that over time it will not only pay for itself but is
          giving you additional income and added property value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding an ADU is something I will want to do once I have a property of
          my own. The benefits of adding one outweighs the initial costs.
          Looking for properties that already have an ADU or that could support
          one is a great way to begin your home buying experience.
          <b>
            Or maybe you are wishing to sell your house and want to add value to
            it; convert that old, empty garage! Instant money in your pocket.
          </b>
          ADU’s are the future of renting and home buying, it is best to get in
          now while costs are still low and the demand is high. Choose the
          contractor that best fits in your budget and style and get a free
          estimate so you can try to plan accordingly. Remember that just like a
          home, extras like a porch or built-in shelves add value to the small
          dwelling that can mean more rental income and more property value for
          you!
